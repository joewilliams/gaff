gaff : Cloud API AMQP daemon

gaff is a pub/sub system for interfacing asynchronously with cloud APIs.

License: apache 2

Features:
* Uses AMQP and the JSON-RPC (http://json-rpc.org/) format
* Easy support for any API
** Currently supports part of the dynect, ec2 and slicehost APIs
** Uses fog (http://github.com/geemus/fog)

Example usage:

$ gaff ./gaff.yml

See examples for how to format your json to send to the queue.

Recent breaking changes:
 * EC2 messages require the region to be set in params, this allows for all support of all regions.
 * With the change to dynect_rest I have changed the "address" field to the more correct "rdata".
