gaff : Cloud API AMQP daemon

gaff is a pub/sub system for interfacing asynchronously with cloud APIs.

License: apache 2

Features:
* Uses AMQP and the JSON-RPC (http://json-rpc.org/) format
* Easy support for any API
** Currently supports part of the dynect, ec2 and slicehost APIs
** Uses fog (http://github.com/geemus/fog)

Example usage:

$ gaff ./gaff.yml

!! recent change, the region ("params":"region") is now required in all ec2 messages !!

Send a JSON-RPC formatted message to the exchange with the a routing key to perform operations on that API.

require 'rubygems'
require 'carrot'

exch = Carrot::AMQP::Exchange.new(Carrot.new, :topic, "api")

hash = {"method" => "add_a_record", "params" => {
            "customer_name" => "gaff.com", 
            "username" => "username", 
            "password" => "password",
            "node" => "test123",
            "zone" => "gaff.com",
            "address" => "127.0.0.1",
            "ttl" => "300"
           }
       }

json = hash.to_json

exch.publish(json, :routing_key => "dynect")
